Efforts such as the [W3C Geo XG](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/geo/), and most recently the [GeoSPARQL](http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/geosparqlswg/) initiative are providing the necessary vocabularies to publish this kind of information on the Web of Data. Map4RDF is a mapping and faceted browsing tool for exploring, visualizing and interacting with RDF datasets enhanced with geospatial information.\r\n\r\nConfigure Map4RDF to use your SPARQL endpoint and provide your users with a nice map-based visualization of your data. The geospatial aspects of the data can be modelled using either the data model from W3C Geo XG or the geometrical data model proposed by GeoLinkedData\r\n\r\nMap4rdf provides:\r\n\r\n* Faceted browser interface.\r\n* Geospatial and geometrical visualization using Google Maps, Open Street Maps and national spatial data infrastructures.\r\n* Visualization of GeoSPARQL WKT geometries (LineStrings, Polygons, etc).\r\n* Visualization of statistical data using DataCube.\r\n* Editing and storing displayed data in RDF data format.\r\n* Query Filtering.\r\n* Easy configuration via an admin panel or a configuration file.\r\n\r\n### Map4RDF deployments\r\nYou can see several deployments of Map4RDF (these sites will be experiencing continuous transformations as we progrees with the development). Some examples are:\r\n* [GeoLinkedData](http://geo.linkeddata.es/)\r\n* [El Viajero](http://webenemasuno.linkeddata.es/)\r\n* [Transport](http://transporte.linkeddata.es/)\r\n* [Meteorological Data - AEMET](http://aemet.linkeddata.es/)\r\n\r\nThere are also external projects that are already using Map4RDF, such as the Ecuadorial Linked Geospatial Data initiative (URL soon to be added).\r\n\r\n### Map4RDF Configuration, Quick Start and FAQ\r\nWe are working on providing a simpler configuration description and tools, but for the time being you can use this [PDF](https://github.com/oeg-upm/map4rdf/blob/master/Map4RDF_Installation_Guide.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMany people have contributed to the development of Map4RDF, including @alexdeleon, @boricles, @fransiro, @pejot, @dgarijo, and @ocorcho (incomplete list).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Map4RDF?
